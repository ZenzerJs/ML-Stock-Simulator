# PRD — ML Stock Simulator (MVP)

## Product Overview
**Product:** ML Stock Simulator  
**One-liner:** A market simulation web app that compares baseline forecasting models on 10 years of data and presents 6-month and 12-month return-% forecasts with bearish/stable/bullish scenarios.

## What this is / isn’t
- This is an educational simulator + model comparison dashboard.
- This is NOT live trading, not a brokerage tool, and not financial advice.

## Target Users
- Primary: Recruiters / hiring managers evaluating SWE + ML-adjacent skills (clean UI, data pipeline, correctness, clarity).
- Secondary: Students/enthusiasts who want to explore forecasts and uncertainty.

## User Journey (core loop)
1. User selects a ticker from a curated list (5–10).
2. User selects a forecast horizon (6 months or 1 year).
3. User runs “Simulate” to fetch history, run models, and compute results.
4. User views:
   - Model comparison metrics
   - A forecast plot with 3 scenarios: bearish / stable / bullish

## MVP Must-Have Features (P0)
### P0.1 Ticker selection + constraints
- Curated list of 5–10 tickers (hardcoded list in MVP).
- Horizon selector: 6 months or 12 months.
- “Simulate” button triggers pipeline.

### P0.2 Data retrieval + preprocessing (10y)
- Fetch 10 years of historical data for the selected ticker.
- Use monthly frequency internally (resample) to support 6/12-step horizons.
- Clean missing values and ensure time index ordering.

### P0.3 Model execution (baseline models only)
- Run 2–3 baseline models (no custom ML invention in v1).
- Output point forecasts per horizon for each model (return %).
- Create a “Scenario Aggregator” that combines model outputs into:
  - Bearish
  - Stable
  - Bullish
  (Defined consistently and documented in the UI.)

### P0.4 Evaluation / backtest results (simulator credibility)
- Run a time-respecting evaluation (walk-forward/rolling split) appropriate for monthly data.
- Show a leaderboard table with metrics (e.g., MAE / RMSE on return %).
- Show a simple chart: actual vs predicted (for the backtest portion).

### P0.5 Results UI (clean + polished)
- Results page/section includes:
  - Summary cards (selected ticker, horizon, date range)
  - Model comparison table
  - Scenario forecast visualization (3 lines/bands)
  - “How scenarios are computed” small explainer text

### P0.6 Non-functional requirements
- Fast enough: one simulation should complete in a reasonable time on free-tier hosting.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigable, focus styles, readable contrast.
- Clear disclaimer: “simulation / educational.”

## Should-Haves (P1) if time
- Save/share a run (URL params for ticker + horizon).
- Export results as JSON/CSV.
- Basic caching of fetched data to avoid repeated downloads.

## Not In MVP (explicit cuts)
- Live trading or buy/sell recommendations.
- User accounts / logins.
- Large model zoo, hyperparameter tuning, or AutoML.
- Real-time streaming prices.
- Portfolio optimization / multi-asset allocations.

## Success Metrics
- MVP success = app is deployed, runs end-to-end, and produces stable outputs for all tickers/horizons.
- Secondary: a recruiter can understand “what it does” within 20 seconds.

## Design Vibe
Clean, professional, techy; subtle motion; minimal clutter.
