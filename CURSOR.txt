# Cursor Rules — ML Stock Simulator

1) Source of truth
- Always read `AGENTS.md` first.
- Follow the roadmap + non-negotiables in `AGENTS.md`.
- If anything is unclear, ask ONE blocking question, then proceed.

2) Workflow (required)
- Plan → Execute → Verify for every change.
- Plan: list files you will create/modify before editing.
- Execute: implement one small feature at a time.
- Verify: run the app and sanity-check the affected flow.

3) MVP scope guardrails
- Do NOT add pages/features outside the MVP without explicit user approval.
- No live trading, no buy/sell recommendations; keep disclaimer visible.
- Keep only 2 horizons: 6 months and 12 months.
- Target is return % and uses 10 years of history (monthly internally).

4) Code quality
- Prefer TypeScript, no `any`.
- Keep business logic in `lib/` (data, models, backtest), UI in `components/`.
- Handle errors explicitly and show user-friendly error states.

5) Verification commands (use what exists in package.json)
- `npm run dev` (manual clickthrough)
- `npm run lint` (if configured)
- `npm run build` before deploy (if time)
