# AGENTS.md — Master Plan (Cursor)

## Project Overview
**App:** ML Stock Simulator  
**Goal:** A deployed market simulation app that compares baseline models on 10y monthly data and shows 6m/12m return-% forecasts with bearish/stable/bullish scenarios.  
**Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind (+ chart lib) (+ Framer Motion)

## How I Should Think
1. Understand intent first; ask 1 clarifying question only if truly blocked.
2. Plan before coding; show file tree changes before implementing.
3. Build incrementally: one feature at a time.
4. Verify after changes: run dev server, click through, fix regressions immediately.
5. Keep MVP scope tight; defer extras to “Not in MVP”.

## Non-Negotiables
- No live trading, no buy/sell recommendations, clear educational disclaimer.
- Two horizons only: 6 months and 12 months.
- Target is return %, not price.
- Use 10 years of history (monthly internally).
- Scenarios must always render: bearish / stable / bullish.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1 — Foundation
- [ ] Initialize Next.js + TS + Tailwind
- [ ] Add `/simulator` page with basic layout
- [ ] Add shared components + styling conventions

### Phase 2 — Data + Pipeline
- [ ] Implement history fetch + monthly transform + return % series
- [ ] Implement baseline model wrappers (2–3)
- [ ] Implement Scenario Aggregator (min/median/max or equivalent deterministic rule)
- [ ] Implement walk-forward evaluation + metrics

### Phase 3 — API + UI Results
- [ ] `POST /api/simulate` returns computed results
- [ ] Results table (MAE/RMSE)
- [ ] Backtest chart (actual vs predicted)
- [ ] Scenario chart (bear/stable/bull)
- [ ] Loading + error handling + disclaimers

### Phase 4 — Polish + Ship
- [ ] Subtle animations only
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness pass
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Sanity test all tickers and both horizons

## Verification Checklist
- `/simulator` loads and can run a simulation
- For each ticker: both 6m and 12m complete without errors
- Results include model table + charts + scenario outputs
- Disclaimer is visible and clear
- No console errors in primary flow
